#Ball Expansion Game

##Aim of the game

The aim of the game is to expand balls in the stage area to allocate more than 2 thirds of the stage area without getting hit by the moving balls
Level difficulty is depicted by speed of the moving the balls, number of the moving balls and size of the stage. 

##TODO

Randomise the direction of the killer balls
Ball collides, calculate direction and velocity - http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/when-worlds-collide-simulating-circle-circle-collisions--gamedev-769
Add Gravity to Newly Created Balls - http://codetheory.in/basics-of-implementing-gravity-with-html5-canvas/
Balls probably need an onFrame event each to check intersects.
